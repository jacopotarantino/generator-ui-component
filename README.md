> Scaffolds a UI Component with ES6, tests, and webpack+babel build. Initializes a git repository. Creates a minimal build process that you can get started with immediately.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-ui-component using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-ui-component
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
mkdir my-fancy-component && cd $_
yo ui-component
```

Make sure to run the sample test suite to make sure things are working as expected:

```bash
npm test
```

Then get started working. A basic `index.html` file is provided for you to prove out your UI component as quickly as possible.

```bash
open index.html
npm start
```
